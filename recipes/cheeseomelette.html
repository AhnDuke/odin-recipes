    <h2>This is a long and boring story about a time I cracked some eggs into a bowl</h2>
    <p>It all started when I was a child</p>
    <p>And now I am banned from 18 different IHOP locations in California.</p>
    <H2>INGREDIENTS</H2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. 
            Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <p> </p>
        <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, 
            so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. 
            Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. 
            Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.
        </li>
        <p> </p>
        <li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. 
            Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. 
            Cook until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.
        </li>
    </ol>
