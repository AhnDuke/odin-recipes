        <li>Place chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. 
            Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching,

        <li>Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until pale and thick, about 5 minutes.

            Pour batter into the prepared ramekins and place on a baking tray.
        </li>
        <p> </p>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sides are set but the middle is still jiggly, 10 to 13 minutes. 
            Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
